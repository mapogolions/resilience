### Resilience

Inspired by [The Polly Project](https://www.thepollyproject.org)

The motivation behind the project is learning by creating. As I delved into the technical details of the Polly library, it seemed to me that the same ideas could be expressed a little more simply.

Please refer to the list below to understand the capabilities of the library. For each policy, there is a short description and an example of how to create it.

- [Essentials](./examples/essentials.md)
- [Fallback](./examples/fallback/README.md)
- [Retry](./examples/retry/README.md)
- [Bulkhead](./examples/bulkhead/README.md)
